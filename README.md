# Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduction using SVD

This repository provides a detailed implementation and explanation of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, an unsupervised learning technique used for **dimensionality reduction**, **data compression**, and **latent semantic analysis** in machine learning.

## 📌 Overview

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization method that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices (U, Σ, Vᵀ). It is commonly used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining its essential structure and variance.
